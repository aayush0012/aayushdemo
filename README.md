This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice code. I’m using it to store and organize problems that I solve regularly while preparing for coding interviews, online assessments, and general problem-solving practice.

Most of the solutions are written in C++. The code reflects my understanding at the time of solving, so some solutions may be optimized later or written differently as I learn better approaches.

This is an ongoing repository and will keep getting updated as I practice more problems across different DSA topics.
